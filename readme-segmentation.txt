Experiment:
    Preferential Listening, Segmentation Experiment (using eye-tracking)

Description:
	Purpose of this experiment is to detect whether an infant participant
	has a preference for one particular type of sound (word, intonation, 
	accent, language etc) over another. The infant sits on the caregiver's 
	lap facing a computer monitor on which visual stimuli will be presented.
	Auditory stimuli will be presented through a speaker. The infants 
	eye-movements will be followed by an eye-tracker. The procedure 
	consists of a short familiarization phase, and a test phase. The trial 
	structure is the same for both phases: first an audio-visual attention 
	getter is presented. Then a visual stimulus is presented together with 
	an auditory stimulus. The auditory stimulus consists of a sequence of 
	sounds (words) of a particular type. For each in the test phase trial 
	the accumulated time the child looks at the visual stimulus is measured.
	If the infant looks away too long during the test phase, the trial is 
	aborted. Output: looking time.
